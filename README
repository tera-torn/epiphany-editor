A map editor for the Boulder-dash clone, Epiphany!

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Feel free to hack on it and send me patches!

epiphany-editor is developed using the git revision control system.

You should see a .git directory which contains the full revision control
history for the project.

Just get git on your system and get hacking!

Cheers,
